# Informal description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has two or a few more cash registers. 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage orders to suppliers
* support accounting

In the following describe the requirements of the EZShop application. 
You are free to define the application as you deem more useful and effective for the stakeholders. 
You are also free to modify the structure of the document when needed.
The document will be evaluated considering the typical defects in requirements (omissions, ambiguities, contradictions, etc), and syntactic errors in the formalism used (UML diagrams). 
Consider that the document should be delivered to another team (unknown to you)
 which will be in charge of designing and implementing the system. The design team should be able to proceed only with the information in the document.

# Business Model

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |
| :--------------: | :---------: |
| Stakeholder x..  |             |

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

| Actor x.. |                   |                    |


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

|  ID   | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|  FR1  |             |
|  FR2  |             |
| FRx.. |             |

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

|   ID    | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..) | Description | Refers to |
| :-----: | :--------------------------------: | :---------: | :-------: |
|  NFR1   |                                    |             |           |

# Use case diagram and use cases

## Use case brief
|  UC name   | Goal         | Description |
| :---:    | :---------: | :---: |
|          |             |       |



## Use case diagram

\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>

\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>

### Use case 1, UC1

| Actors Involved  |                                                                      |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Precondition   | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |
|  Post condition  |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished>   |
| Nominal Scenario |         \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC>         |
|     Variants     |                      \<other normal executions>                      |
|    Exceptions    |                        \<exceptions, errors >                        |

##### Scenario 1.1

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

|  Scenario 1.1  |                                                                            |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Precondition  | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
| Post condition |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished>   |


Steps

# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the application, and their relationships>

\<concepts must be used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design

\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>

# Hardware Software architecture

\<describe here the hardware software architecture using UML deployment diagram >
